Python code to Reindex VAMAS files for CasaXPS as output by the Kratos ESCApe software

## Credits:
This is an updated verion of that from skoopsy (https://github.com/skoopsy/reindex-VAMAS/) to add a basic graphical interface for multiple uses.
Full credit is given to them for the initial version

## Description:
   This script will read a directory of VAMAS files (.vms) and attempt to re-index the blocks so that each block
   is on the same row. It is very limited and will only work for VAMAS files where every scan set up is similar.
   It works well when you have many scans and have to manually set the index of each block to the same row for each sample.
